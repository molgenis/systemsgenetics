## Introduction 
Decon2 is a statistical framework for estimating cell counts using molecular profiling such as expression or methylation data from heterogeneous samples (Decon-cell) and consecutive 
deconvolution of expression quantitative trait loci (Decon-eQTL) into each cell subpopulation.  
See [DeconCell](https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/tree/master/Decon2/DeconCell) and [Decon-eQTL](https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/tree/master/Decon2/DeconCell) for their documentation.

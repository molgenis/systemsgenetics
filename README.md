Installing local jars:
To install the necessary local jars, which are not available on maven, you need to run "Install-local-jars.bat" (on windows) or "Install-local-jars.sh" (on OS-X or Linux).
To do so you need to install maven and add it to your path variable.
Then run the correct script in your systemsgenetics maven directory.

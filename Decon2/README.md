## Introduction 
Decon2 is a statistical framework for estimating cell counts using molecular profiling such as expression or methylation data from heterogeneous samples (Decon-cell) and consecutive 
deconvolution of expression quantitative trait loci (Decon-eQTL) into each cell subpopulation.  
See DeconCell/ and Decon-eQTL/ for their documentation.
